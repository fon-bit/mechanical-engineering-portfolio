# Bracket Static Structural Analysis â€“ MEEN 432 Project 1

## Overview
This project applied **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** in **ANSYS** to study the static structural performance of an **aluminum alloy bracket**. The analysis focused on understanding how **mesh refinement** impacts simulation results for deformation, stress, and error distribution.

## Objectives
- Apply loads and supports to the bracket model:
  - Fixed support at the bottom  
  - Force applied at the bearing surface (Fx = 5500 N, Fy = 3500 N, Fz = 1700 N)  
- Compare three different mesh resolutions (2, 4, 6).  
- Evaluate results for:
  - **Total deformation**  
  - **Equivalent (von-Mises) stress**  
  - **Structural error**  

## Results
- **Finer meshes** produced higher maximum values for both deformation and stress, improving result precision.  
- Stress concentration locations became more accurate as mesh density increased.  
- Structural error plots confirmed that areas of maximum stress aligned with regions of high error, highlighting the need for mesh refinement.  
- While finer meshes improved accuracy, coarser meshes provided acceptable results with less computational cost.
