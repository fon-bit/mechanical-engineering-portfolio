# Transient Simulation 

## Overview
This project focused on performing a transient heat transfer simulation using ANSYS Fluent. An irregular polygon model (bounded within a 1 m Ã— 1 m domain) was analyzed to study temperature distribution over time under various boundary conditions. The objectives included:

Evaluating the effect of meshing accuracy (coarse, medium, and fine meshes) on simulation results.

Setting up transient boundary conditions including constant temperature, convection, and insulation.

Comparing results across mesh resolutions to ensure accuracy while optimizing computational efficiency.

Determining the time required for the system to reach steady state.
