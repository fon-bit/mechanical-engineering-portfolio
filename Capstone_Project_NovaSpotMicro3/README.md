# Capstone Project â€“ Nova Spot Micro 3

## Overview
The Nova Spot Micro 3 was our senior design capstone project. The goal was to design and prototype a quadruped robot capable of walking and stair climbing using a pre-built frame and motors.

## My Role
- Designed and 3D modeled the robotâ€™s frame in Fusion360.  
- Performed stress analysis simulations to verify load capacity.  
- Modeled leg motion to ensure clearance during walking.  
- Collaborated with electrical and computer engineers for motor testing.  

## Tools Used
- Fusion360  
- ANSYS (stress analysis)  
- PLA 3D printing  
- Motor drivers, sensors  

## Results
- Successfully built a working prototype.  
- Verified the frame could withstand a total weight of up to 15 lbs.  
- Simulated stair climbing and walking sequences.
