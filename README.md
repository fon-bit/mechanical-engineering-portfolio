## 📂 Projects

### 🔹 [Capstone Project – Nova Spot Micro 3](Capstone_Project_NovaSpotMicro3/README.md)
- **Objective:** Prototype a quadruped robot using a pre-built frame and motors (Nova SM3)
- **My Role:** 3D modeled the frame in Fusion360/Ansys, ran stress analysis in Ansys, simulated walking in software
- **Tools:** Fusion360, ANSYS, 3D printing  
- **Outcome:** Completed a functional robot prototype capable of walking and surrounding detection
