*40% Mechanical Keyboard PCB*

## Overview
This is a personal passion of mine and I've always wanted to try a 40% keyboard and instead of spending $150+ on a prebuilt I decided to spend 150hrs and even more money on building a custom one! All joking aside this has been a passion of mine for a while and I wanted to share with the world my journey in the world of custom keyboards. As of now I'm in the design phase for the case, the pcb is currently under review at the manufactors!! Check at the files and images for this project and feel free to leave me some feedback!

## Objectives
- Designed a custom 40% mechanical keyboard from scratch
- Designed in KiCad, manufacturable PCB (*manufactuered approve*)
- Case design using Fusion360 (*under review @manufactures*)

## Deliverables
- 40% keyboard PCB
- Custom Case Design 
- Final Assembly of keyboard
