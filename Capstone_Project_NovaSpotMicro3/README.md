# Capstone Project ‚Äì Nova Spot Micro 3

## Overview
The **Nova Spot Micro 3** was our senior capstone project, developed by a multidisciplinary team of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers. The objective was to design, analyze, and prototype a quadruped robot capable of walking and climbing stairs while maintaining balance and structural integrity.  

This project integrated **mechanical design, structural analysis, electronics, and control systems** into a cohesive platform, showcasing advanced problem-solving and cross-disciplinary teamwork.

## Design & Analysis
- **Frame:** 18 in √ó 4 in √ó 3 in, PLA (75% hollow, lightweight yet structurally sound).  
- **Legs:** Coax‚Äìfemur‚Äìtibia design, lengths 6 in (femur) and 5 in (tibia).  
- **Load Capacity:** Designed for total robot weight ‚â§ 15 lbs.  
- **Analysis Performed:**  
  - Stress and deflection analysis of PLA frame.  
  - Clearance simulations for walking and stair climbing.  
  - Verification of motor placement and load-bearing capability.
