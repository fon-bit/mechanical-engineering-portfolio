# Maze Fluid Flow Analysis â€“ Project

## Overview
This project used **ANSYS Fluent (Fluid Flow system)** to analyze fluid behavior through two maze configurations. The study demonstrates how **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** can be applied to evaluate velocity patterns, contours, and flow characteristics in complex geometries.

## Objectives
- Apply CFD to evaluate two maze designs with identical entrances and exits but different paths.  
- Use meshing to ensure accuracy by selecting an element size smaller than the maze path width.  
- Configure velocity inlets and outlets for simulation setup.  
- Visualize fluid movement with **velocity pathlines** and **velocity contours**.  

## Method
- Two maze models were prepared:  
  - **Maze 1:** single live path with a dead path.  
  - **Maze 2:** two live paths with a dead path.  
- The mazes measured **24 in Ã— 12 in**, with a meshing element size of **0.05 in**.  
- Velocity inlets and outlets were defined to simulate fluid entry and exit.  
- Fluent generated velocity pathlines to show particle movement and velocity contours to illustrate acceleration, deceleration, and stagnation regions.  

## Results
The analysis highlighted:  
- Flow acceleration around corners and reduced velocity near walls and dead ends.  
- Regions of recirculation and stagnation, visible in pathline plots.  
- Velocity distribution differences between Maze 1 and Maze 2 due to the number of paths.  

These results demonstrate how CFD can reveal inefficiencies and improve the understanding of **fluid flow in piping or channel systems**.
