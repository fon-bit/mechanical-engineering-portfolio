# Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases selected coursework and projects from my **Mechanical Engineering** degree, including my senior **Capstone Project: Nova Spot Micro 3**.

Each project folder contains:
- Project Report (PDF)
- Supporting files (code, data, presentations)
- A README with project overview

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [Capstone Project â€“ Nova Spot Micro 3](Capstone_Project_NovaSpotMicro3/README.md)
- **Objective:** Prototype a quadruped robot using a pre-built frame and motors (Nova SM3)
- **My Role:** 3D modeled the frame in Fusion360/Ansys, ran stress analysis in Ansys, simulated walking in software
- **Tools:** Fusion360, ANSYS, 3D printing  
- **Outcome:** Completed a functional robot prototype capable of walking and surrounding detection
