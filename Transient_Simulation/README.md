# Transient Simulation 

## Overview
This project explored **transient heat transfer analysis** using **ANSYS Fluent**. An irregular polygon model (bounded within a 1 m Ã— 1 m square) was simulated to investigate **temperature distribution over time** under different boundary conditions.

## Objectives
- Evaluate the effect of **meshing accuracy** (coarse, medium, fine).  
- Configure **transient boundary conditions**: constant temperature, convection, insulation.  
- Compare simulation results across mesh resolutions for accuracy and efficiency.  
- Determine the **time required to reach steady state**.  

## Results
- All three meshes (coarse, medium, fine) produced similar results, confirming accuracy.  
- The system reached **steady state at ~8500 seconds**.  
- Contour plots showed correct thermal behavior:  
  - Heated walls warmed first.  
  - Insulated walls resisted external cooling.  
  - Convection wall cooled fastest due to outside air interaction.
