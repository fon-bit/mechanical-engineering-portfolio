# Capstone Project â€“ Nova Spot Micro 3

## Overview
The Nova Spot Micro 3 was our senior design capstone project. The goal was to design and prototype a quadruped robot capable of walking using a pre-built frame and motors.

## My Role
- Designed and 3D modeled the robotâ€™s frame and legs in Fusion360 and ANSYS.  
- Performed stress analysis simulations to verify load capacity.
- Modeled leg motion to ensure clearance during walking and no stress between leg joints.  
- Collaborated with electrical and computer engineers for motor testing.
- Gather documents from each group and ensure cohesiveness in report.  

## Tools Used
- Fusion360  
- ANSYS   
- 3D printing  

## Results
- Successfully built a working prototype
- Verified the frame could withstand a total weight of up to 10 lbs 
- Simulated walking in software
