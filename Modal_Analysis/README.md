# Bracket Modal Analysis â€“ Project

## Overview
This project applied **modal analysis** in ANSYS to study the dynamic behavior of a simple bracket. Modal analysis is used to determine a structureâ€™s **natural frequencies** and **mode shapes**, which are essential for understanding how a system responds to vibration. This helps engineers identify potential resonance issues that could cause excessive vibrations and structural failure.

## Objectives
- Perform modal analysis on a bracket model.  
- Identify the structureâ€™s natural frequencies and mode shapes.  
- Visualize deformation patterns to locate weak or flexible regions.  
- Apply results to support safer and more reliable designs.  

## Method
- The same bracket model from earlier projects was used.  
- A **tetrahedron patch-independent meshing** method was applied.  
- Fixed supports were included, while external loads were removed.  
- Modal analysis results were generated in ANSYS to display the bracketâ€™s mode shapes.  

## Results
The analysis provided the bracketâ€™s natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. These results highlight how the bracket would deform under vibrational loading and identify areas that could be optimized to prevent resonance. The findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for dynamic effects in structural design.
