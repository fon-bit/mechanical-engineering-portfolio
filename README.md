## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [Capstone Project â€“ Nova Spot Micro 3](Capstone_Project_NovaSpotMicro3/README.md)
- **Objective:** Design and prototype a quadruped robot using a pre-built frame and motors.  
- **My Role:** 3D modeled the frame in Fusion360, ran stress analysis, simulated walking clearance.  
- **Tools:** Fusion360, ANSYS, PLA 3D printing, motor testing.  
- **Outcome:** Completed a functional robot prototype capable of walking and stair climbing.

### ðŸ”¹ [Heat Conduction Simulation](Heat_Conduction_Simulation/README.md)
- **Objective:** Simulated 2D heat conduction in a material with varying boundary conditions.  
- **Tools:** MATLAB.  
- **Deliverables:** Report with results and MATLAB code.

### ðŸ”¹ [Fluids Lab â€“ Sluice Gate](Fluids_Lab_SluiceGate/README.md)
- **Objective:** Measured upstream/downstream flow depths and forces on a sluice gate using manometers.  
- **Tools:** Lab instrumentation, Excel for data analysis.  
- **Deliverables:** Report with experimental vs theoretical force comparisons.
