**Custom 40% Mechanical Keyboard PCB**

## Overview
This is a personal project of mine (feel free to use any file as your own!). Always wanted to try a 40% keyboard and instead of spending $150+ on a prebuilt I decided to spend 150hrs and even more money on building a custom built keyboard! 
## Objectives
-Designed a custom 40% mechanical keyboard PCB from scratch
-Matrix scanning, per-key diodes, USB interface, MCU selection
-Designed in KiCad, manufacturable PCB
